i'd like to extend my gratitude to a few folks for their contributions:

to ola lundqvist, for wwwconfig-common, whose code served as an initial
base for much of the underlying db management functions.

to andreas tille for template suggestions, german debconf translations
and spending the time discussing the some potential real-world aspects
of dbconfig-common.

likewise to karsten hilbert, also for additional postgres specific suggestions

to oliver elphick for much postgres specific knowledge, and a few other ideas

to christian perrier for many suggestions on the debconf templates
concerning grammar, punctuation, and translator friendliness.

to tobias grimm, julien blache, and miguel gea milvaques for testing,
ideas, and patches.

all the other list members of debian-devel who shared their ideas and thoughts
