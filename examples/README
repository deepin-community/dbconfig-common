hello!

this directory contains a number of example packages which show
how dbconfig-common can be used in various situations:

- db-test-mysql 

	a simple mysql database application.

- db-test-mysql-perl

	like the above, but instead of using dbconfig-common's native
	setup code, the information is gathered and passed to a
	maintainer-provided or upstream-provided script.

- db-test-mysql-frontend

    a "read-only frontend" package.  this package prompts for all the
    pertinent information, but performs no database-modifying actions.

- db-test-pgsql

	like db-test-mysql, but for applications that work with postgres.

- db-test-pgsql-migration

    the same as above, but provided with a "1.9" version that doesn't
    use dbconfig-common, which illustrates how in the "2.0" version
    dbconfig-common can migrate previously existing settings.

- db-test-multidbtype

	this package shows how dbconfig-common can be used to configure
	applications that work with any number of database types supported
	by dbconfig-common.  currently this is only mysql/pgsql, but
	work is in progress to support others, such as oracle and sqlite.

also, you probably see that one of the packages (db-test-mysql) has
two versions available.  this simply shows how dbconfig-common can
support application upgrades that require making modifications to
the underlying database.

you can build all these packages at once by simply running the
provided ./buildpackages.sh script if you're lazy :)

enjoy!
